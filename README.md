# gRPC-TensorFlow
This is an experimental repository investigating the possibility of transferring tensorflow models across a network. 
## Roadmap:
- Write a model generator file (DONE)
- Write a model encoder file (DONE)
- Write a model decoder file (DONE)
- Generate protobuf service for serving this model transfer (DONE)
- Write a server file (DONE)
- Write a client file (DONE)
- Write a weight encoder method within model encoder class
- Write a weight decoder method within model decoder class
